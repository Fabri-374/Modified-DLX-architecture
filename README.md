# Modified-DLX-architecture
We developed and enhanced the DLX architecture's Integer Unit with an extended instruction set, hardwired control unit, advanced datapath, and efficient multiplier. Features include data forwarding, hazard detection, and stall management. The process involved detailed simulations, synthesis, and place &amp; route, culminating in the final layout.
